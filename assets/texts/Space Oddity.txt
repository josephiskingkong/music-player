Ground Control to Major Tom
<br>Ground Control to Major Tom
<br>Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
<br>(Ten) Ground Control (Nine) to Major Tom (Eight, seven)
<br>(Six) Commencing (Five) countdown, engines on
<br>(Four, three, two)
<br>Check ignition (One) and may God's love (Lift off) be with you
<br>
<br>This is Ground Control to Major Tom
<br>You've really made the grade
<br>And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
<br>Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
<br>This is Major Tom to Ground Control
<br>I'm stepping through the door
<br>And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
<br>And the stars look very different today
<br>
<br>For here am I sitting in my tin can
<br>Far above the world
<br>Planet Earth is blue
<br>And there's nothing I can do
<br>
<br>Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
<br>I'm feeling very still
<br>And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
<br>Tell my wife I love her very much
<br>She knows
<br>Ground Control to Major Tom
<br>Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
<br>Can you hear me, Major Tom?
<br>Can you hear me, Major Tom?
<br>Can you hear me, Major Tom?
<br>Can you?
<br>
<br>Here am I floating 'round my tin can
<br>Far above the moon
<br>Planet Earth is blue
<br>And there's nothing I can do
